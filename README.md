# Restaurant Ratings Prediction and Enhancement

## Executive Summary

This project, conducted in collaboration with FoodieBay, focuses on uncovering the drivers behind restaurant ratings and predicting them. By utilizing machine learning models including linear regression, decision tree regressors, and clustering, we aim to enhance restaurant performance and improve recommendations. The decision tree regressor was found to offer superior predictive power, enabling personalized recommendations, tailored marketing strategies, and overall improved performance in the restaurant industry.

## Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Table Booking:** Restaurants offering table booking generally have higher median ratings than those that do not.
- **Online Ordering:** Restaurants with online ordering have slightly higher median ratings.
- **Cost & Reviews:** Higher average cost for two and higher average customer review rankings correlate with higher ratings.
- **Restaurant Types:** Casual Dining and Bar have the highest ratings, while Takeaway has the lowest. Average cost for two varies across restaurant types.
- **Top & Bottom Performers:** Top restaurants include Asia Kitchen and Flechazo; bottom performers include Alibi and Bhagini. BTM city has the most restaurants.
